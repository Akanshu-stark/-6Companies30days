# #6Companies30days
This is the challenge given by Arsh Goyal sir 6 Companies in 30 days challenge. I accepted that challenge as an opportunity to learn something and try my level best to put some time every day in coding to flourish good coding culture and to revise and enhance my DSA so that I can crack major companies interview questions.

I want to thank you to Arsh Goyal sir to conduct these type of challenges as they keep us motivated throughout the interview process and learn something from them.
